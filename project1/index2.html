            <p>Jon Jones is the greatest Mixed Martial Artist of all time. He has defended his crown 14 times, the most title defences
              in the history.

          </div>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Canadian Mixed Martial Artist, The True one. He was the best in his job, he has every skill that true mixed martial Artist
              need. Just because he had 2 mistakes in his own fighter's history, that cost as loses for him, people, mostly Americans,
              Jon's fans, don't call him a GOAT, but for me, to understand every detail, he is the best.

          <div class="panel">
            <p>The best one in The Midlleweight. He has too many bangers in his career. Fought also in th LHW just for fun, that was just
              amazing for fans. That's why also too many people call him the GOAT.

            <p>Guy, who had amazing skills in a ground game, too many world class submissions and amazingly, knockout power, which isn't as
